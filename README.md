# Udacicards

## About

This project is the final project in the Udacity React NanoDegree. For this project, we were challenged to create a mobile flashcard application using React Native. All features have been tested to be working on Android Nougat and on iOS 11.

## Development

Getting started is simple. Assuming that you have up-to-date versions of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), all that is required is to run:

~~~~
yarn install
yarn start
~~~~

That's it! No backend server or dependencies that are not handled by `yarn`.

Alternatively, you can likely use `npm` but **this has not been tested** so *caveat emptor*.

## Acknowledgements

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app), and utilizes [Expo](https://expo.io/).
